selectors -> to target the things to apply css

direct elements ->
    p{
        --> will be applied to all the paragraphs 
    }
    
    body{
        -> to the big body container
    }

    *{
        ->  universal selector   applies to all the things
    }
classes ->
    .className{

    }

combination ->
    h1, h2{
        -> will be applied to both h1 and h2
    }

    p span{
        will search for span inside p
    }


notes -> css is read from top to bottom and rules written below will be applied except for more specific selector
i.e let's say class and element selector are compared then class is more specific so class rules are applied

inheritance -> property inherited by an element from its parent element

eg

body{
    -> if some code of body is applied to other elements than it is inheritance
}

*{
    -> this is not inheritance it is selection of all the elements
}

specificity -> id > class > element

also

p{
    color: purple!important    --> increases specificity
}

#para1{
    stylings;
}  -> will be applied to the id = "para1"

div, p{
    selects all <div> elements and all <p> 
    elements 
}
